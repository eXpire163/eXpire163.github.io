## Is this something you can image to get into?

You probably tried now lots of different things in the sim and had lots of fun with huge helicopers or extreme jets or maybe even with a 1/3 scale piper cub. **Don't by anything like that yet!!!**

### Find a local club

Good your town name and combine it with rc/model airplane and the changes are pretty good that you find something.
Types of clubs
1. Just for fun - small crappy airfield and you can fly what you want - no matter how old or cheap it was.
2. Normal Clubs - medium airflied - wide variaty of mentality
3. Bigger Clubs - prefessional airflied, clubhouse, youth group - sometimes expect that everyone has to fly a 3000$ or more model to call it rc-flying,

If the club in your town feels not right for you, have a look at a club in the surrounding. There will be one that meet your style.

What all clubs have in common that is that you need to have a insurance (~50$ a year in germany)

### Lisence? / Legal?

Learn about the rules from your club. Or checkout the [Kenntnisnachweis](https://kenntnisnachweisonline.dmfv.aero/) from the dmfv

## Hardware

What else do i need?

1. Remote Controll
There are tons of different brands and styles out there - but ask the people at your local club on with systems they can help you with
   1. if you just want something that works and works with lots of stuff - use spektrum
   2. if you are a developer - get a radiomaster tx16s and get into openTX/edgeTX
   3. if you want to fly a jet - get a jeti system

Just make sure you get something you can connect to the pc / simulator

2. Charger

Start with a simple "4 button" charger and later when you know what you want get a 2-4 port charger
