## Struggle to find a way to modern IT?

Cloud, DevOps, SRE, Serverless and many more terms are everywhere today and most likely will not disappear anywhere soon.
So get a good starting point is really important.

## Who are you?

Ask yourself what kind of person you are and pick your way.

### Afraid of all the new thinks

I created a small workshop where you get get your hands dirty and learn all the terms hands on.

**Goal**: Get a website from a local text file into a container and automate the steps needed.

### Curious about everything and want to be where the fun is

AWS provides an great workshop, where you learn how to setup your first kubernetes cluster in the cloud step by step.

Goal: Get into AWS and Kubernetes at the same time

### Already arrived in the agile world but want to go the next step

Google started with a new way of working some years ago and published the book "Site Reliability Engineering". This can be overwhelming so they drilled to down to a few videos that get your thinking right and helps to make the next step:

**Goal**: Get int SRE and start adapting today

### I need a plan

DevOps is such an open field that it is really easy to loose the goal out of your eyes. Thats why the so called devops roadmap was created. It gives you nice summery of what you might want to know and dive into some of the topics. Just a tip: don't get to deep into everything, get a basic idea of everything is way more useful.

**Goal**: Setup your skill set for the future (or at least the present)
